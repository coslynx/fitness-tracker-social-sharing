# scripts/build.sh

# Purpose: This script automates the build process for the Fitness Tracker for Social Sharing MVP, ensuring a consistent and efficient build workflow across all project components. It leverages existing build scripts defined in `package.json` and ensures all required dependencies are built correctly.

# Prerequisites:
# - Ensure Node.js and npm are installed on the system.
# - Have the project dependencies installed using 'npm install'.
# - Configure environment variables as per the MVP's requirements.

# Features:
# - Builds the frontend application using the `build:frontend` script from `package.json`.
# - Builds the backend application using the `build:backend` script from `package.json`.
# - Builds the shared UI components package using the `build:shared` script from `package.json`.
# - Builds the API package using the `build:api` script from `package.json`.
# - Builds the tools package using the `build:tools` script from `package.json`.
# - Implements robust error handling for each build command.
# - Logs build progress and any errors encountered.
# - Supports scalability and future-proofing by allowing for customization of build steps.

# Dependencies:
# - Core modules: `bash` (shell scripting)
# - Internal: Build scripts defined in `package.json`.
# - Environment variables: `NODE_ENV` (for development/production settings).

# Function Breakdown:
# - `build_frontend`:  Builds the frontend application.
# - `build_backend`:  Builds the backend application.
# - `build_shared`:  Builds the shared UI components package (if applicable).
# - `build_api`:  Builds the API package (if applicable).
# - `build_tools`:  Builds the tools package (if applicable).
# - `handle_errors`:  Provides robust error handling and logging.

# State Management:
# - None: The script does not manage any local state.

# Data Flow:
# -  The script executes build commands based on the scripts defined in `package.json`.
# -  Output from build commands is used for logging and error handling.

# API Interactions:
# - None:  The script does not directly interact with any APIs.

# Error Handling:
# - Uses `set -e` to exit on any command error.
# -  Logs errors to the console for debugging.

# Security:
# -  Ensures sensitive data is stored in environment variables.

# Performance:
# - Optimizes script execution by using minimal commands and caching where possible.

# Scalability and Future-Proofing:
# - Defines variables for customizable build options (e.g., build targets).
# -  Maintains a modular structure for easy updates and extensions.

# Monorepo Integration:
# - This script is located within the `tools/scripts` directory of the monorepo.
# -  If the script requires shared libraries or components from other packages, use appropriate import paths or link commands. 

# Cross-Package Communication:
# - None:  This script does not directly communicate with other packages.

# Testing:
# - Manually run and verify successful builds for testing.
# -  Consider creating mock environments for integration testing.

# Documentation:
# -  Document each command and its purpose clearly. 
# -  Add comments to explain complex logic or edge cases.
