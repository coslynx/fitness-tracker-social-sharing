# scripts/deploy.sh

# Purpose: This script automates the deployment process for the Fitness Tracker for Social Sharing MVP, ensuring a consistent and efficient deployment workflow. 

# Prerequisites:
# - Ensure Node.js and npm are installed on the system.
# - Have a Vercel account (if deploying to Vercel) and configure Vercel CLI.
# - Create a `.env` file in the root of the project with environment variables (e.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `SENTRY_DSN`).
# - Install dependencies for the project using `npm install`.

#  Feature Breakdown:
# -  Build the application.
# - Deploy the application to Vercel.
# -  Run post-deployment steps if needed.
# - Implement robust error handling for all commands.
# -  Utilize appropriate exit codes for script failure (e.g., `exit 1`).
# -  Log errors to a file for debugging.

# Dependencies:
# - Core Modules: `bash` (shell scripting)
# - Third-party: Vercel CLI (`vercel`)
# - Internal: Build scripts defined in `package.json`
# - Environment Variables: `VERCEL_TOKEN` (your Vercel API token), `NODE_ENV` (for development/production settings).
# - Configuration Files: `.env` (environment variables), `vercel.json` (Vercel deployment configuration).

#  Function Breakdown:
# - `build_app`:  Builds the application using the defined build script from `package.json`.
# -  `deploy_vercel`: Deploys the application to Vercel using the `vercel` CLI.
# -  `run_post_deployment_steps`: Executes any post-deployment tasks as specified in the MVP requirements.
# -  `handle_errors`:  Provides robust error handling for all commands, logging errors to a file.

#  State Management:
# -  None:  The script does not manage any local state.

#  Data Flow:
# -  Environment variables are accessed from the `.env` file.
# -  Build artifacts are generated by `build_app` and used by `deploy_vercel`.

#  API Interactions:
# - None: The script does not directly interact with any APIs. 

#  Error Handling:
# - Uses `set -e` to exit on any command error.
# -  Logs errors to a file for debugging using `handle_errors`.

#  Security:
# -  Ensures sensitive data is stored in environment variables.
# -  Securely manages Vercel token.
# -  Implement rate limiting or request throttling if necessary.

#  Performance:
# - Optimizes script execution by using minimal commands and caching where possible.

#  Scalability and Future-Proofing:
# -  Defines variables for customizable deployment options (e.g., Vercel project name).
# -  Maintains a modular structure for easy updates and extensions.

#  Monorepo Integration:
# - This script is located within the `tools/scripts` directory of the monorepo.
# -  If the script requires shared libraries or components from other packages, use appropriate import paths or link commands. 

#  Cross-Package Communication:
# - None:  This script does not directly communicate with other packages.

#  Testing:
# - Manually run and verify successful deployments for testing.
# -  Consider creating mock environments for integration testing.

#  Documentation:
# -  Document each command and its purpose clearly. 
# -  Add comments to explain complex logic or edge cases.
