# This script orchestrates the build process for the Fitness Tracker for Social Sharing MVP, ensuring a consistent and efficient build workflow across all project components.

# 1. Prerequisites:
# - Ensure Node.js and npm are installed on the system.
# - Have the project dependencies installed using 'npm install'.
# - Configure environment variables as per the MVP's requirements.

# 2. Build the Frontend Application:
npm run build:frontend

# 3. Build the Backend Application:
npm run build:backend

# 4. Build the Shared UI Components Package (if applicable):
npm run build:shared

# 5. Build the API Package (if applicable):
npm run build:api

# 6. Build the Tools Package (if applicable):
npm run build:tools

# 7. Optional Steps:
# - Run any necessary database migrations:
#   - 'npm run migrate' (if using Prisma)
# - Run any post-build scripts or configurations.

# 8. Error Handling:
# - Implement robust error handling for all commands.
# - Use appropriate exit codes for script failure (e.g., 'exit 1').
# - Log errors to a file for debugging.

# 9. Security:
# - Ensure all sensitive data is properly stored in environment variables ('.env' file).
# - Securely manage any sensitive tokens or keys used in the build process.

# 10. Performance:
# - Optimize the build process using caching where possible.
# - Minimize the number of commands executed for efficiency.
# - Utilize asynchronous operations where appropriate.

# 11. Extensibility:
# - Define functions for specific build steps to enhance code organization and reusability.
# - Provide documentation and comments for complex logic and configuration options.

# 12. Integration with Other MVP Components:
# - This script depends on existing build scripts defined in 'package.json'.
# - Ensure that all required environment variables and configuration files are available.

# 13. Scalability and Future-Proofing:
# - This script should be easily adaptable to different build environments and configurations.
# - Define variables for customizable build options.
# - Implement a modular structure for easy maintenance and updates.

# 14. Monorepo-Specific Considerations:
# - Ensure this script is located within the 'tools/scripts' directory of the monorepo.
# - If the script requires shared libraries or components from other packages, use appropriate import paths or link commands.
# - Define versioning guidelines for this script if it's part of a shared package.

# 15. Cross-Package Communication:
# - This script doesn't directly communicate with other packages.
# - However, ensure any shared dependencies are correctly managed.

# 16. Testing and QA:
# - Test the script thoroughly by manually running it and verifying successful builds.
# - Consider creating mock environments for integration testing.
# - Document all test cases and ensure comprehensive code coverage.
# - Implement continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) to automate testing and deployment.

# 17. Code Quality:
# - Follow the established coding standards and conventions of the MVP.
# - Use clear and concise comments for explanation.
# - Refactor code for readability and maintainability.

# Example Usage:
# - Run this script from the root directory of your project.
# - Ensure all environment variables are set in the '.env' file.

# Ensure constant reference to this prompt and the existing codebase for seamless integration and high-quality implementation.
