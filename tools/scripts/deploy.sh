# This script automates the deployment process for the Fitness Tracker for Social Sharing MVP, ensuring a consistent and efficient deployment workflow.

# 1. Prerequisites:
# - Ensure Node.js and npm are installed on the system.
# - Have a Vercel account (if deploying to Vercel) and configure Vercel CLI.
# - Create a `.env` file in the root of the project with environment variables (e.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `SENTRY_DSN`).
# - Install dependencies for the project using `npm install`.

# 2. Build the application:
npm run build

# 3. Deploy to Vercel:
vercel deploy --prod --token=$VERCEL_TOKEN

# 4. Post-deployment steps (optional):
# - Run any necessary database migrations:
#   - `npm run migrate` (if using Prisma)
# - Restart the application or relevant services.
# - Trigger any post-deployment scripts or configurations.

# 5. Error Handling:
# - Implement robust error handling for all commands.
# - Use appropriate exit codes for script failure (e.g., `exit 1`).
# - Log errors to a file for debugging.

# 6. Security:
# - Ensure all sensitive data is properly stored in environment variables (`.env` file).
# - Securely manage your Vercel token (e.g., use a dedicated environment variable or secret).
# - Implement rate limiting or request throttling for the API if necessary.

# 7. Performance:
# - Optimize the build process using caching where possible.
# - Minimize the number of commands executed for efficiency.
# - Utilize asynchronous operations where appropriate.

# 8. Extensibility:
# - Define functions for specific deployment steps to enhance code organization and reusability.
# - Provide documentation and comments for complex logic and configuration options.

# 9. Integration with Other MVP Components:
# - This script depends on existing build scripts (`npm run build`) and deployment tools (Vercel CLI).
# - Ensure that all required environment variables and configuration files are available.

# 10. Scalability and Future-Proofing:
# - This script should be easily adaptable to different deployment platforms and configurations.
# - Define variables for customizable deployment options.
# - Implement a modular structure for easy maintenance and updates.

# 11. Monorepo-Specific Considerations:
# - Ensure this script is located within the `tools/scripts` directory of the monorepo.
# - If the script requires shared libraries or components from other packages, use appropriate import paths or link commands.
# - Define versioning guidelines for this script if it's part of a shared package.

# 12. Cross-Package Communication:
# - This script doesn't directly communicate with other packages.
# - However, ensure any shared dependencies are correctly managed.

# 13. Testing and QA:
# - Test the script thoroughly by manually running it and verifying successful deployments.
# - Consider creating mock environments for integration testing.
# - Document all test cases and ensure comprehensive code coverage.
# - Implement continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) to automate testing and deployment.

# 14. Code Quality:
# - Follow the established coding standards and conventions of the MVP.
# - Use clear and concise comments for explanation.
# - Refactor code for readability and maintainability.

# Example usage:
# - Run this script from the root directory of your project.
# - Ensure all environment variables are set in the `.env` file.
# - Replace `YOUR_VERCEL_TOKEN` with your actual Vercel token.

# Ensure constant reference to this prompt and the existing codebase for seamless integration and high-quality implementation.
