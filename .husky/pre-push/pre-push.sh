# .husky/pre-push/pre-push.sh

# Purpose: This script executes pre-push checks to ensure code quality, test coverage,
# and adherence to established coding standards before pushing changes to the
# remote repository. It safeguards against potential code issues, enhances the 
# reliability of the Fitness Tracker MVP, and maintains a consistent high-quality
# codebase.

# Features:

# 1. Lint code using ESLint to enforce code quality and best practices.
# 2. Format code using Prettier to maintain consistent code style across the project.
# 3. Run unit and integration tests using Jest to ensure code functionality.
# 4. Validate code coverage using a code coverage tool (e.g., Jest's built-in
#    coverage reporting) to enforce minimum coverage thresholds.
# 5. Implement robust error handling, providing informative messages to the user.
# 6. Optimize for performance and resource efficiency.
# 7. Integrate seamlessly with the existing codebase.

# Dependencies:

# - Core modules:
#    - bash (shell scripting)
# - Third-party:
#    - ESLint (eslint)
#    - Prettier (prettier)
#    - Jest (jest)
# - Internal:
#    - Build scripts defined in package.json 
# - Environment variables:
#    - NODE_ENV (for development/production settings)
# - Configuration files:
#    - .eslintrc.js (ESLint configuration)
#    - .prettierrc (Prettier configuration)
#    - jest.config.js (Jest configuration)

# Execution logic:

# 1. Check if the script is running in development mode:
#    - If so, skip certain checks (e.g., Jest tests).
#    - If not, run all checks (linting, formatting, testing, coverage).

# 2. Run ESLint with the appropriate configuration defined in .eslintrc.js.
# 3. Run Prettier with the appropriate configuration defined in .prettierrc.
# 4. Run Jest with the appropriate configuration defined in jest.config.js.
# 5. Validate code coverage using a code coverage tool.

# Data Management:

# - None:  The script does not manage any data directly.

# Network Requests:

# - None:  The script does not make any network requests.

# Error Handling:

# - Check the exit codes of each command.
# - If any command fails, print an error message and exit with a non-zero exit code.

# Logging:

# - Log the execution of each command, including the command and its output.
# - Log any errors encountered with specific details for debugging.

# Performance Optimization:

# - Utilize caching mechanisms for ESLint, Prettier, and Jest where applicable.
# - Consider using a separate script to handle performance optimization tasks.

# Security:

# - Ensure all sensitive data is properly stored in environment variables.
# - Validate any user input (if applicable) and sanitize it for security.
# - Implement input validation and sanitization rules to prevent XSS and CSRF attacks.

# Integration with Other MVP Components:

# - package.json:  This file depends on build scripts defined in package.json.
# - jest.config.js, .eslintrc.js, .prettierrc:  These files define configurations for Jest, ESLint, and Prettier.

# Scalability:

# - This script is designed to be scalable by using built-in command-line tools.
# - Consider using a separate script for handling complex pre-push checks as the MVP grows.

# Monorepo Integration:

# - This file is located within the .husky/pre-push directory of the monorepo.
# - The script leverages shared libraries and components from other packages by using appropriate import paths defined in package.json.

# Cross-Package Communication:

# - None:  This script does not directly communicate with other packages.

# Testing and QA:

# - Unit tests are not typically needed for this type of script.
# - Integration tests should be implemented to verify that the script correctly executes ESLint, Prettier, and Jest.
# - Performance tests should be implemented to measure the script's execution time and optimize it.

# Linting and Code Formatting:

# - Use ESLint with the eslint-config-next configuration for linting.
# - Use Prettier with the default configuration for code formatting.

# Documentation:

# - Document each command and its purpose clearly.
# - Add comments to explain complex logic or edge cases.

# Code Example:

# This code example should be expanded and customized to meet the specific needs of your project.
# Ensure constant reference to this prompt and the existing codebase for seamless integration and high-quality implementation.
